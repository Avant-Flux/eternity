Widget class structure


---------- Core Widgets ----------
*** Universal and reuseable ***
----------------------------------
DrawContext
=== Establishes drawing context
=== Draw context should have coordinate system just like Gosu::Window,
=== so that widgets can be drawn inside
	|-->	Widget
	===	Establishes basic structure and options for widgets
		|-->	Button
		=== Clickable button
			|--> ToggleButton
			=== While button only fires an event when clicked
			=== toggle buttons fire both a down and up event,
			=== and will record their state (either :up or :down)
		
		|-->	ProgressBar
		=== Linear progress bar
		
		|-->	CircularStatusBar
		=== Like ProgressBar, but draws in a circle
		
		|-->	SpeechBubble
		=== Speech bubbles which appear in-world when characters talk
		
		|-->	TextBox
		=== Base for both TextArea and TextField
		=== Only exists to hold overlapping code from those two classes
			|-->	TextArea
			=== Multi-line text input
			
			|-->	TextField
			=== Single-line text input
				|-->	Label
				=== Displays text, but can not be edited by the enduser
					|-->	Tooltip
					=== Defines the behavior of mouseover tooltips
					=== Similar to label, but appears on mouseover
					=== Drawn using world coordinates instead of screen coordinates
					=== 	like the way most other widgets do
		
		|-->	TextHandler
		=== Currently, this file does nothing
		=== TODO: Remove ineffectual file
		
ScrollingContext /// NOT YET IMPLEMENTED ///
=== Like DrawContext, but provides a scrollbar
=== TODO: Implement this and get rid of ScrollingDiv


InterfaceEventListener
=== Base class for all events
*** Mouse events should be implemented as collisions between the mouse and the widget
*** Thus, use the collision handler interface
	|-->	mouse_down
	=== Click event released
	=== Collision pre_solve and mouse button down
	
	|--> 	mouse_up
	=== Click event
	=== Collision pre_solve and mouse button NOT down
	
	|--> 	mouse_in
	=== Mouse is over widget
	=== Collision begin
	
	|--> 	mouse_out
	=== Mouse has moved away from the widget
	=== Collision separate
	
	|--> 	
	===
