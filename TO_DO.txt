To-do List

===	Finish stat system
	---	Try to use as few stats as possible
		+	Or, at the very least, as few raw stats as possible
	---	Implement some sort of randomness in character creation
		+	People with the same nature natures are similar not clones

===	Fix camera scrolling
	---	Needs to stop when the character hits a wall or similar object
	---	Temporarily fixed by having the camera follow exactly the x and y position of 
		the Entity being followed

===	Fix camera elevation
	---	Camera does not adjust elevation to match that of the Entity being tracked.
		This results in the character not being at the center of the screen when
		jumping or standing on a raised platform.
		+	Allow smooth scrolling on this plane as well
		
===	Cut-Away buildings
	---	When the player opens a door into a building, the exterior world should fade
		to black, and the interior of the building should be displayed on the same
		foundation.

===	Hide buildings to show alleys etc
	---	When the character passes a building, it should fade a bit if there is a alley
		behind it, so that if there are multiple buildings in a row with alleyways
		between them, the player will be able to see the alleys.
		+	This is extremely important when/if the buildings are taller than the 
			viewport.

=== Monkey patch Gosu::Image so the z-index does not need to be passed.  Instead, pass the 
	x y and z coordinates in meters, and the method will automatically convert to pixels and 
	draw.
	--- This should also include calculating the z-index of the image.  Thus, the coordinates
		of the object in Chipmunk space could be passed, and the correct pixel coordinates
		calculated.

===	Allow using structs for the height of environment pieces
	---	This allows for uneven tops of buildings etc.
	
===	Create ramp objects

===	Fix shadow placement error.
		Shadows for Character objects are being placed slightly off center.   
		This does not effect the player, however.
		---	Correction, this does effect the Player objects as well.
		---	The problem is the that the down-facing sprite is slightly off.	
		
===	Re-write the InputHandler class is Ruby style for increased readability
	---	Reimpelement InputHandler to only use :active and :idle states
		+	right now, the intermediate states of :begin and :finish seem unnecessary
	
	---	Allow nested InputType instances
		+	Currently can only use buttons in InputType
		+	This would allow for truly complex input
			*	Example, ask the user to press a button then double-tap something else.
				This could be used for something like a smash attack.

===	Fix implementation of speech bubbles
	---	Move speech bubble into a separate class
	---	Should automatically manage which bubbles are currently active
		+	Automatically destroy bubble after the timeout
		+	Change the text of the bubble instead of creating a new one if the text is
			modified before the timeout
	---	Use a custom class for a text box
		+	Class which controls rendering the text in a specific area, but does not
			draw borders etc around the text.



===Build New Tools
	---Level Editor
		( )	Can place art assets on screen, including characters, objects, parts of the 
			landscape, and buildings.
			
		( )	Should respect Chipmunk physics of those objects.
			+	Thus, when moving the objects, it will not be possible to move them into
				positions where objects overlap in Chipmunk space.
			
				
				
	---Graphical Bounding Box Editor
		( )	Perhaps part of the level editor, this would display a given image on screen with
			a sort of wireframe for the bounding box.  The box could then be altered either with
			the mouse or the arrow keys.
			
		( )	It would be cool to be able to load up a quick test scene in the engine to test 
			the bounding box. 
			
		( )	The bounding box data should be saved to a YAML file which can be later read
			to create the proper bounds for that object in Chipmunk space, or edited again
			in the editor.
